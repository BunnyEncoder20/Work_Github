# Borg Backups

Great question üëå Let‚Äôs break this down into **two parts**:

---

## üü¢ Is Borg open source?

Yes ‚úÖ

* **BorgBackup (Borg)** is **open source** under the **BSD license**.
* Repo: [https://www.borgbackup.org/](https://www.borgbackup.org/)
* Actively maintained, battle-tested in production for years.
* Features:

  * Built-in **encryption (AES-256 / authenticated)**
  * **Deduplication** (saves huge space if many files/VMs share blocks)
  * **Compression** (zstd, lz4, etc.)
  * **Incremental backups** natively
  * Remote backups over SSH

So Borg is very much a solid OSS choice.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Borg vs MinIO (on-prem S3 backup)

You‚Äôre basically comparing:

* **Borg** = a **backup tool** (handles dedup, encryption, versioning, scheduling).
* **MinIO** = an **object storage system** (like AWS S3 but on-prem).

They solve **different problems**, but here‚Äôs why Borg may feel ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in certain backup use cases:

### üîπ Borg Advantages

1. **Purpose-built for backups**

   * Deduplication ‚Üí only unique data is stored (huge savings).
   * Incremental backups are ‚Äúfree‚Äù (it only stores changes).
   * Restores are faster and more direct.

2. **Encryption Built-In**

   * Data is encrypted client-side before leaving the server.
   * With MinIO you‚Äôd need to handle encryption separately (either app-level or server-side).

3. **Efficiency**

   * Borg stores data as chunks, so if you change a few MB in a large file, only those blocks are re-stored.
   * With MinIO, if you use tar/zip dumps ‚Üí the whole file/object might get re-uploaded.

4. **Smaller Infra Footprint**

   * Borg only needs SSH + storage (can even be just external drives).
   * MinIO requires a whole object storage setup with replication, credentials, etc.

### üîπ MinIO (S3-style) Advantages

1. **Scalable Storage**

   * MinIO can scale across servers with erasure coding, replication, and load balancing.
   * Better if you have **petabytes of data** and need high availability.

2. **Standardized API**

   * Uses the **S3 API** ‚Üí compatible with tons of tools, SDKs, and backup software (like Veeam, Restic, Velero).
   * Easier if your ecosystem already uses S3-like storage.

3. **Object Storage**

   * Great for unstructured data (logs, images, documents).
   * Supports versioning and lifecycle rules.

---

## ‚ö° The Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

You can actually **combine** them:

* Use **Borg/Restic** for deduplication, compression, and encryption.
* Configure Borg to store its backup repository **on MinIO** (via `rclone` or S3 gateway).
* That way:

  * Borg handles efficiency and encryption.
  * MinIO gives you scalable, resilient storage.

---

‚úÖ **Rule of thumb**:

* If you want **pure backup efficiency, dedup, encryption, simple ops** ‚Üí go with **Borg**.
* If you want **scalable object storage for many apps, not just backups** ‚Üí go with **MinIO**.
* If possible, **Borg ‚Üí MinIO backend** = strong solution.

Would you like me to sketch out a **sample architecture diagram** of how Borg + MinIO + offline storage could work in your on-prem setup? That might make it clearer.
