The main playlist I'm following: [Primeagen - Vim As Your Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6AR2RMB5tE&list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R)

## 1. Video 1 - Introductions
Commands used:
-  h = left
-  j = down
-  k = up
-  l = right

-  :wq = write, quit
-  w =  one word forward (to the beginning of the word)
-  b = one word back (to the beginning of the word)
-  can combine numbers with motions to specify how many times that motion is to be done (ex: '3k' -> up 3 lines up)

-  d = delete (dd = delete a line, 'dw' = delete one word forward, 'd7k' = delete 7 line's up - etc.)
-  u = undo last change
-  ctrl + r = redo last change

-  general order of motions: command (ex: d, p) number (3, 5) motion (w, k)
-  i = insert (cursor on left)
-  a = insert (cursor on right)
-  v = enter visual mode
-  Shift + V = enter visual line mode
-  ctrl + v = enter visual x mode)
